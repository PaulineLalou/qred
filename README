# Usage
View Users: Navigate to the home page to view a list of all users.
Edit User: Click on "Edit this user" to navigate to a user's profile page, where you can view and edit their information.

# Testing 
Running Cypress Tests

Ensure your application is running locally, either in a separate terminal window or as a background process. You can run your application using a command like:
npm run start

- Running Tests:

Once the Cypress Test Runner is open, you will see a list of test files. Click on E2E testing and the test file you wish to run (e.g., userListAndProfile.cy.js). Cypress will execute the test in a new browser window, and you can observe the running tests in real-time.

# Future Improvements
Implement user authentication.
Add unit and integration tests.
Enhance UI/UX design.
Add more user interactions like deleting a user or adding a new user.
